    "The Deadly triad consists of three factors: Bootstrapping, Function Approximation, and Off-Policy learning. The three combined have the danger of divergence. With bootstrapping you use the estimated values of next states to update the current state, which can become problematic, as the weights of the network are updated simultaneously for every state with function approximation. When using Off-Policy learning, the agent might learn on actions that the target would take infrequently and when expectations are increased, they can be left unchecked, blowing off and leading to divergence. DQNs use all three. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the book it is mentioned that if the behavior policy is sufficiently close to the target, like in the case of epsilon-greedy, Q-learning is not found to diverge. They then discuss using methods of avoiding the deadly triad such as using MC to avoid Bootstrapping or Sarsa to be On-Policy. One can also use Double Q-learning, Target Net"
